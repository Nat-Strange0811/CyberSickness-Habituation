# CyberSickness-Habituation
Code for masters thesis, looking at analysing the changing patterns in EEG data over the course of a habituation study. The main file contains the control to run 4 different analysis pathways, as well as whether to 'split' the data into seperate runs, and then whether to 'stack' the data. Either take the final run, or stack all runs into one data field.
